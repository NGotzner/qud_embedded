# QUD effects on the interpretation of embedded quantifiers

The project is a follow-up on and combination of the following three papers:

- Chemla & Spector 2011
- Potts, Lassiter, Levy & Frank 2015
- Degen & Goodman 2014 

Wee add Degen & Goodman style QUD manipulations to the Chemla and Potts style paradigms for assessing the derivation of local implicatures.

The question: does the QUD affect the probability of implicatures in sentences where "some" is embedded under "each", e.g. "Each girl found some of her marbles"?
