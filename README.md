# QUD effects on the interpretation of embedded quantifiers

The project is a follow-up on and combination of the following four papers:

- Chemla & Spector 2011
- Potts, Lassiter, Levy & Frank 2015
- Degen & Goodman 2014 
- Gotzner & Benz, 2018

Wee add Degen & Goodman style QUD manipulations to the Chemla and Potts style paradigms for assessing the derivation of local implicatures.

The question: does the QUD affect the probability of implicatures in sentences where "some" is embedded under "each", e.g. "Each girl found some of her marbles"?

## Design

Critical sentence: Each girl found some of her marbles

4 contextual QuD conditions: each-all, any-all, all-any, any-any
4 pictorial/inference conditions: literal, weak, strong, false

Critical comparison: QuD effect on weak and literal condition

## Hypotheses

1. Embedded implicatures are computed locally by the grammar
2. Embedded implicatures are dependent on the contextual QuD making alternatives relevant

## Predictions 

Model for critical comparison: 2 inference conditions (weak, literal) x 4 QuD conditions

1. Embedded implicatures are insensitive to QuD manipulations
literal > weak in all QuD contexts

2. Interaction between QuD and inference condition
literal > weak in each-all QuD context
literal = weak in any-any QuD context
? literal > weak in any-all QuD context
? literal = weak in all-any QuD context

Overall inference pattern: false > literal > weak > strong
Baseline: No effect of QuD manipulation on false and strong control conditions
